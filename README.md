## USAGE

TODO

## TODO AND EXTENSIONS

### globally
- finish package structure / declarations
- enhance tests

### preprocessing
- thread preprocessing - DONE. 
    - multiprocessing with spawns to test
- compute distance beetween preprocessings. Keep only significative ones (mean / variance) - Done
- use previous result to design for the tree of preprocessing - Done
- validate scaling / normalization pattern (before / within / after preprocessing) - Done

- scaleY
- save (xy_scalers and y_inverse_scalers)

### sets
- save / load
- compressed representation to minimize memory print

### augmentation
- noises and data structures

### learning
- all
