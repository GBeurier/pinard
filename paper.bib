Although the main objective of this study is to provide a review of machine learning (ML) algorithms that have been reported for analyzing near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy from traditional machine learning methods to deep network architectures, we also provide different NIR measurement modes, instruments, signal preprocessing methods, etc. Firstly, four different measurement modes available in NIR are reviewed, different types of NIR instruments are compared, and a summary of NIR data analysis methods is provided. Secondly, the public NIR spectroscopy datasets are briefly discussed, with links provided. Thirdly, the widely used data preprocessing and feature selection algorithms that have been reported for NIR spectroscopy are presented. Then, the majority of the traditional machine learning methods and deep network architectures that are commonly employed are covered. Finally, we conclude that developing the integration of a variety of machine learning algorithms in an efficient and lightweight manner is a significant future research direction.},

	abstract = {Abstract The near infrared (NIR) spectra technique is an effective approach to predict chemical properties and it is typically applied in petrochemical, agricultural, medical, and environmental sectors. NIR spectra are usually of very high dimensions and contain huge amounts of information. Most of the information is irrelevant to the target problem and some is simply noise. Thus, it is not an easy task to discover the relationship between NIR spectra and the predictive variable. However, this kind of regression analysis is one of the main topics of machine learning. Thus machine learning techniques play a key role in NIR based analytical approaches. Pre-processing of NIR spectral data has become an integral part of chemometrics modeling. The objective of the pre-processing is to remove physical phenomena (noise) in the spectra in order to improve the regression or classification model. In this work, we propose to reduce the noise using extreme learning machines which have shown good predictive performances in regression applications as well as in large dataset classification tasks. For this, we use a novel algorithm called C-PL-ELM, which has an architecture in parallel based on a non-linear layer in parallel with another non-linear layer. Using the soft margin loss function concept, we incorporate two Lagrange multipliers with the objective of including the noise of spectral data. Six real-life dataset were analyzed to illustrate the performance of the developed models. The results for regression and classification problems confirm the advantages of using the proposed method in terms of root mean square error and accuracy.},

	abstract = {Spectroscopy including Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-destructive and rapid technique applied increasingly for food quality evaluation, medical diagnosis, manufacturing, etc. The qualitative or quantitative information using NIRS is only obtained after spectra data calibration process based mathematical knowledge in chemometrics and statistics. This process naturally involves multivariate statistical analysis. Machine learning as a subset of AI (artificial intelligence), in addition to conventional multivariate statistical tools, seems to get more popularity for chemometric calibration of NIRS data nowadays. However, often the software/toolboxes in chemometrics are commercialized version which is not free. For the free versions, programming skills are required to deal with applications of machine learning in spectra data calibration. Therefore, this paper introduces a different approach of spectra data calibration based on visual programming approach using Orange data mining, a free software which is still rarely used by the research community in spectroscopy. The data used namely: pesticide sprayed on cabbage (to classify between pure cabbage and pesticide-sprayed cabbage with different level of pesticide solution), mango sweetness assessment (to predict sugar soluble content in mango based on Brix degree value). These two data represent classification and regression respectively. This approach is intended more for researchers who want to apply machine learning calibration in their spectroscopy data but don\textquoteright{}t want to have rigorous programming jobs, i.e. for non-programmers.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the attractive features of extreme learning machine (ELM), a simple ensemble ELM algorithm, named EELM, is proposed for multivariate calibration of near-infrared spectroscopy. Such an algorithm takes full advantage of random initialization of the weights of the hidden layer in ELM for obtaining the diversity between member models. Also, by combining a large number of member models, the stability of the final prediction can be greatly improved and the ensemble model outperforms its best member model. Compared with partial least-squares (PLS), the superiority of EELM is attributed to its inherent characteristics of high learning speed, simple structure and excellent predictive performance. Three NIR spectral datasets concerning solid samples are used to verify the proposed algorithm in terms of both the accuracy and robustness. The results confirmed the superiority of EELM to classic PLS. Also, even if the experiment is done on NIR datasets, it provides a good reference for other spectral calibration.},

A multi-task learning approach using trace norm regularization is employed to estimate the transformation matrix in direct standardization, and then is extended to the construction of the nonlinear transformation. The proposed approach is compared with the piecewise direct standardization (PDS) on two real data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach sometimes outperforms the conventional PDS method, and the multi-task learning method can be a promising way to overcome the over-fitting problem existing in direct standardization.},

	abstract = {During the nearinfrared spectroscopy analysis process, modeling the quantitative relationship between the collected spectral information and target components is an important procedure. Before using the traditional modeling methods, it is often necessary to select the most featured wavelengths and eliminate those uninformative wavelengths. However, the wavelength selection algorithms can not only increase the model complexity but also may contain some adjustable parameters, which need the users to have more expertise knowledge and experiences. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a novel endtoend quantitative analysis modeling method for nearinfrared spectroscopy based on convolutional neural network (CNN), which directly takes the whole range of collected raw spectral information as input without wavelength selection. The public corn NIR dataset was taken as example to validate the efficiency of proposed method. The experimental results showed that, firstly, if all the whole range of raw spectral information was taken as the input of modeling, the generalized performance of CNN outperforms the traditional methods, and the difference is statistically significant; secondly, if the traditional methods were combined with wavelength selection algorithms, their generalized performances were similar to CNN model; there is no statistical difference. The results indicated that applying the deep learning methods (take CNN as representative) to establish the quantitative analysis model of nearinfrared spectroscopy is easy to use and has more potential popularize values.},

Most of the identification algorithms use supervised learning and require previous knowledge of existing categories to construct the mathematical models that will be later used at runtime. The use of non-supervised neural learning algorithms is not a common tool in identification of near infrared spectra, although they are widely employed as a pattern recognition technique. Problems analogous to NIR identification have already been solved by means of non-supervised neural networks. Their main advantages are the ability to learn from examples as well as the processing speed, once they are trained. We present in this work a preliminary study of a non-supervised classifier built using Kohonen self-organising maps (SOM). The result is a model useful for identification of a group of NIR spectra belonging to 15 pure products. The accuracy of the classification is discussed. The generalisation of the method for more complex data is still an open issue.},

A challenging set of mixtures, containing a low level of an alcohol with a spectrum very similar to one of the major components, was used as a test for the various techniques. The genetic algorithm approach succeeded in locating three wavelengths, which together were capable of generating a model which predicted unknown mixtures very well.},

@misc{Near,
	title = {Near infrared spectroscopy: the practical chemical imaging solution},
	abstract = {Chemical imaging spectroscopy is an exciting new analytical advance that answers commonly asked questions such as what chemical species are in a sample, how much of each is present, and most importantly, where are they located? Through the fusion of traditional infrared spectroscopy with powerful microscopic and macroscopic imaging capabilities, chemical imaging spectroscopy answers all these questions simultaneously, in a single rapid measurement.1 Chemical imaging enables the researcher to obtain spatial and spectral information characterising samples with unprecedented ease, speed and spatial and spectral resolution. The methodology is aimed at providing a comprehensive analysis of complex heterogeneous samples. Chemical imaging has advanced significantly with the commercialisation of infrared focal plane arrays (FPAs), which are cameras composed of many thousands of individual infrared detector elements. When coupled with infrared optics and a means of wavelength selection, these instruments provide an image where varying contrast is derived from the unique infrared chemical signature characteristic of each component within the sample. Powerful statistical and chemometric tools can enhance these chemical maps by performing valuable data reduction steps to identify and extract the most analytically useful information. This can be invaluable to winnow the large volumes of data collected by this technique. Infrared and near infrared (NIR) imaging, in particular, has the experimental flexibility to characterise a wide variety of samples chemically using transmission and reflectance measurements, while its ability to tackle samples ranging in size from microns to kilometers using microscopes or satellite-based remote sensing systems, makes it truly unique. The large format infrared cameras currently available, particularly in the NIR, provide high image fidelity and coupling these arrays to precise infrared wavelength selection devices with narrow bandpass capabilities including Fourier transform spectrometers1,2 and liquid crystal tunable fi lters3 make the technique fully hyperspectral. In fact, most commercially available spectral imaging systems have spectral resolutions comparable to those of conventional infrared and NIR spectrometer systems. This type of instrumentation has already started to supplant time-consuming mapping techniques, particularly in the infrared spectral region, in which data is recorded one spectrum at a time and the image is constructed by moving the sample in an x,y pattern under the spectrometer optics. It is likely that infrared array-based imaging approaches will completely replace single-point mapping techniques in the future. Although we have applied this general hyperspectral imaging approach to tackle a number of biological and industrial problems in the past, and have developed a variety of instruments and methods for mid-infrared, NIR and Raman imaging we will focus in this paper on industrial chemical imaging problems using NIR diffuse reflectance only. We believe that this spectral interval strikes a perfect balance between sensitivity, flexibility, simplicity and ruggedness that makes it an ideal industrial imaging tool. In addition, we will illustrate through several examples the unique features that chemical sensing with array detectors affords. With the application of quantitative data analysis in these examples, we will show it\textquoteright{}s not just about pretty pictures. Foundations of chemical imaging},
