	abstract = {Last decade's advances and modern aspects of near infrared spectroscopy are critically examined and reviewed. Innovative instrumentation, highlighted by portable and imaging instruments, chemometrics data multivariate processing, and new and valuable applications are presented and discussed. Because of these advances, this mature analytical technique is continually experiencing renewed interest. The drawbacks and misuses of the technique and its supporting mathematical tools are also addressed. The principal achievements in the field are shown in a critical manner, in order to understand why the technique has found intensive application in the most diverse and modern areas of analytical importance during the last ten years.},

	abstract = {Data from functional trait databases have been increasingly used to address questions related to plant diversity and trait-environment relationships. However, such databases provide intraspecific data that combine individual records obtained from distinct populations at different sites and, hence, environmental conditions. This prevents distinguishing sources of variation (e.g., genetic-based variation vs. phenotypic plasticity), a necessary condition to test for adaptive processes and other determinants of plant phenotypic diversity. Consequently, individual traits measured under common growing conditions and encompassing within-species variation across the occupied geographic range have the potential to leverage trait databases with valuable data for functional and evolutionary ecology. Here, we recorded 16 functional traits and leaf hyperspectral reflectance (NIRS) data for 721 widely distributed Arabidopsis thaliana natural accessions grown in a common garden experiment. These data records, together with meteorological variables obtained during the experiment, were assembled to create the AraDiv dataset. AraDiv is a comprehensive dataset of A. thaliana’s intraspecific variability that can be explored to address questions at the interface of genetics and ecology.},

    abstract = { Science-based approaches to agricultural and environmental management are needed to accelerate development progress in the world's poorest countries. We present a diagnostic surveillance framework modelled on medical diagnostic approaches for evidence-based management of agriculture and environment in developing countries. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy can play a pivotal role in making the surveillance framework operational, by providing a rapid, low cost and highly reproducible diagnostic screening tool. We review the wide applicability of IR spectroscopy for setting up measurement systems for the management of soils, crops, agricultural inputs, livestock health, agricultural products and water quality. IR spectroscopy is already being used in the design of soil surveillance systems, but the principles are generally applicable. A new evidence-based interpretation approach to plant analysis, combining plant and soil IR spectroscopy measurements, is proposed. Finally, an idealised design is proposed for making IR spectroscopy-based diagnostic surveillance operational in developing countries over the next ten years. Large area surveillance frameworks for agricultural and environmental problems will deploy integrated spectral indicators of soil, crop and livestock health and water quality. Spectral indicators will help to quantify risk factors associated with problems and assess intervention impacts. Smallholder farmers will have access to IR spectroscopy-based analysis of soils, crops and inputs through a network of hand-held or mobile IR spectroscopy units. Agricultural processing industries will make extensive use of IR spectroscopy on the factory floor to add value to agricultural produce and improve food safety. Regional centres of scientific and technological excellence will be required to support (i) high quality laboratory reference analyses, (ii) development of IR spectroscopy calibration databases and interpretation systems and (iii) up-grading of scientific and technical skills through training and education. Key challenges for adoption of this design include (i) building human capacity in science- and technology-based approaches, (ii) development of rugged low cost IR spectroscopy instrumentation and (iii) development of decision support systems to interpret IR spectroscopy data into management recommendations. }

Although the main objective of this study is to provide a review of machine learning (ML) algorithms that have been reported for analyzing near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy from traditional machine learning methods to deep network architectures, we also provide different NIR measurement modes, instruments, signal preprocessing methods, etc. Firstly, four different measurement modes available in NIR are reviewed, different types of NIR instruments are compared, and a summary of NIR data analysis methods is provided. Secondly, the public NIR spectroscopy datasets are briefly discussed, with links provided. Thirdly, the widely used data preprocessing and feature selection algorithms that have been reported for NIR spectroscopy are presented. Then, the majority of the traditional machine learning methods and deep network architectures that are commonly employed are covered. Finally, we conclude that developing the integration of a variety of machine learning algorithms in an efficient and lightweight manner is a significant future research direction.},

This study applies deep learning to spectral analysis techniques and proposes a rapid analysis method for cereals. First, the advanced features of the near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) were extracted by the deep learning-stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) method, and then the prediction model is built using the affine transformation (AT) and the extreme learning machine (ELM). Experiments were conducted on corn and rice data sets to verify the effectiveness of the method. The results show that the proposed method achieves good prediction results and is superior to other typical NIR analysis methods.},
