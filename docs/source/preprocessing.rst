PreProcessing Module
====================
:mod:`pinard.preprocessing`


The ``preprocessing`` module in Pinard provides a comprehensive collection of preprocessing methods tailored specifically for NIRS (Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) data. These methods are designed to address various challenges in NIRS data analysis, such as baseline correction, noise reduction, normalization, and feature extraction. By utilizing the ``preprocessing`` module, users can effectively preprocess their NIRS data and enhance the quality of subsequent analysis and modeling.

Preprocessing Methods
---------------------

Pinard's ``preprocessing`` module offers a wide range of preprocessing methods for NIRS data. Some of the key methods available include:

- Baseline Correction: This method corrects for the baseline offset in NIRS spectra, helping to remove systematic variations unrelated to the analyte of interest.

- Standard Normal Variate (SNV): SNV is a normalization technique that removes multiplicative effects caused by variations in scattering and particle size, allowing for better comparison across spectra.

- Robust Normal Variate (RNV): RNV is a robust version of SNV that is less affected by outliers and extreme values in the data, improving the reliability of the normalization process.

- Savitzky-Golay Filtering: This method smooths the NIRS spectra by fitting a polynomial function to the data, reducing noise and enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio.

- Normalization: The normalization technique adjusts the scale of NIRS spectra, ensuring that different samples are comparable and removing scaling effects.

- Detrending: Detrending removes long-term trends or drifts in NIRS spectra, which may be caused by instrument instabilities or changes in environmental conditions.

- Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC): MSC corrects for scattering effects in NIRS spectra, enhancing the accuracy of quantitative analysis.

- Derivative Computation: Derivative computation calculates the rate of change of NIRS spectra, highlighting subtle spectral features and improving the discrimination between different sample groups.

- Gaussian Filtering: Gaussian filtering smooths the NIRS spectra by convolving the data with a Gaussian function, reducing noise and preserving important spectral characteristics.

- Haar Wavelet Transformation: This transformation decomposes NIRS spectra into different frequency bands, allowing for analysis at different scales and extracting relevant features.
